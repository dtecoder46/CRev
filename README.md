## How to Use
1. Go to the CRev repository on GitHub
2. Fork the repository
3. Write code in main.crv
4. Type "./script.sh" in the terminal
5. Type "./script2.sh" in the terminal
6. Answer the prompt

## Changes to C++ syntax
1. No "#" in front of the "include" keyword
2. "namespace" not required, "using namespace std" would now be "using std"
3. Arrow syntax (<< and >>) not required in inputs and outputs
4. "cout" is now "out", "cin" is now "in"
5. "else if" changed to "elif" like Python
6. **SEMICOLONS NOT REQUIRED :D**
7. Will be taking any other suggestions to simplify C++

## How the compiler works
1. The compiler will read the code in main.cr
2. The compiler has a preset list of keywords
3. If any keywords are detected, the compiler outputs the matching C++ code
4. All the C++ code is then written into compiled.cpp
5. When you run script2.sh, compiled.cpp is run
